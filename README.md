# atmor

An experimental R package to handle multiple dataset issues i.e., from data cleaning/handling to plotting and so on.
Currently handles NAs only.

There are three basic functions as part of this package.

1) check_NA
This function checks whethere there are NA in the data frame.

2) find_NA
This function locates rows and columns in a data frame having NA.

3) fix_NA
This function replaces NAs by the blanks.
